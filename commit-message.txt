MDK-405: Add unified PAYOUT_ADDRESS environment variable

Introduce a new PAYOUT_ADDRESS env var that simplifies payout configuration
by accepting multiple formats: LNURL, Lightning Address, Bolt12 Offer, and
BIP-353. The address type is automatically detected based on format.

Add a new unified `payout` handler that mdk.com can call without needing
to specify the payment type. The handler reads PAYOUT_ADDRESS, detects
the address type, and routes to the appropriate payment method.

Legacy WITHDRAWAL_BOLT_11, WITHDRAWAL_BOLT_12, and WITHDRAWAL_LNURL env
vars are maintained for backwards compatibility but now emit deprecation
warnings encouraging migration to PAYOUT_ADDRESS.

Changes:
- Add payout-address.ts module with address type detection
- Add unified payout handler (handlers/payout.ts)
- Register `payout` route in route.ts
- Update pay_bolt_11, pay_bolt_12, and pay_ln_url handlers
- Export payout-address utilities from @moneydevkit/core
- Update .env.example with new variable and deprecation notes
- Add comprehensive tests for address detection and payout handler
