MDK-333: Move successUrl from metadata to top-level parameter

Update demo app and all READMEs to pass successUrl as a top-level
option in the navigate() call instead of inside metadata. This aligns
with the new validation that prevents reserved keys in metadata and
ensures metadata remains a readonly payload for custom user data only.

Changed files:
- examples/mdk-nextjs-demo/app/page.tsx
- README.md
- packages/nextjs/README.md
- packages/replit/README.md
