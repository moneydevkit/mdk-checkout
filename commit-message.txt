MDK-370: Show sandbox QR code in preview mode

Sandbox users testing from Replit preview URLs were seeing real
Lightning invoices that would fail or retry indefinitely because
preview URLs are temporary and unstable.

Changes:
- Display a fake/demo QR code in preview mode instead of a real
  Lightning invoice that could fail
- Add a prominent "Sandbox Mode" banner explaining that real
  payments require deploying to a stable URL
- Add visual indicators (amber coloring, "DEMO" badge) to make
  it clear the checkout is in sandbox mode
- Rename "Mark as Paid" button to "Simulate Payment" for clarity
- Hide expiry timer and exchange rate details in preview mode
  since they don't apply to sandbox invoices
